Our countries are allies in both NATO and the European Union. However, our primary relationship is that of friends and neighbours. I am very grateful for this. The Minister will be present at our base in Łask today, where preparations are underway for the arrival of the F-35. Poland and the Czech Republic purchase the F-35 aircraft, with deliveries scheduled to commence in due course. These matters have already been discussed in an advanced manner, and our own experience and the skills acquired by our pilots are being shared. It is very significant that the exchange of expertise, data and technology is occurring between our nations - stated Deputy Prime Minister W.

Poland is a reliable ally, and we are committed to upholding our obligations as set forth in the North Atlantic Treaty. We expect the same level of commitment from our allies. The most pressing security concerns were discussed, and I also delivered a presentation on the provision of assistance to Ukraine. I emphasised that Poland has been providing support to Ukraine since the outset of the conflict, implementing a whole range of possible measures to assist the country. On behalf of the Chief of the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces, General Dymanowski presented details of the support provided to Ukraine. The Secretary General and his delegation were highly impressed by Poland's actions since the outset of the war in Ukraine – W. Kosiniak – Kamysz said following the meeting with the NATO Secretary General.</title><link>https://www.gov.pl/web/national-defence/news</link><description>- We discussed, with NATO Secretary General, the most pressing challenges facing NATO, Poland's role within the Alliance, and the nature of our interactions.

It is like a milestone and a cornerstone at the same time. This represents a significant milestone in the fields of missile defence and air defence for all NATO countries, for Europe and for the United States. The installation of the US base in Redzikowo will serve to enhance the security of Europe, the United States, Poland and NATO as a whole. It will contribute to the strengthening of the most powerful alliance in the modern world - Deputy Prime Minister W. Kosiniak - Kamysz stated during the opening of the base in Redzikowo.</title><link>https://www.gov.pl/web/national-defence/news</link><description>- The deployment of an American destroyer on Polish soil becomes a reality, representing a significant development in the security history of Poland, the United States and NATO, and marking a notable shift in the geopolitical landscape.

This serves as an exemplar of the Corps' capacity for continuity, stability, and functionality. It is noteworthy that, following a quarter of a century of the Corps' presence in Szczecin, we are witnessing another change of command, which symbolises the continuity of the Corps. Freedom needs strength. It will not be able to defend itself. It is a highly valuable concept, but in the context of daily threats, it requires a unified determination and courage. For 75 years, NATO has constituted the most robust defence alliance in history. It safeguards peace, security and our civilisation - stated Deputy Prime Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz during a visit to the Headquarters of the Multinational Corps Northeast.</title><link>https://www.gov.pl/web/national-defence/news</link><description>- It is a great moment marking the culmination of 25 years of the Multinational Corps Northeast' presence in Szczecin with a change of command.

We are strong partners, for which I express my sincerest gratitude. I am very pleased to be in Bratislava today, accompanied by Minister of Infrastructure Dariusz Klimczak, who is currently engaged in bilateral discussions. This is not a mere coincidence; it is the result of a strategic decision to cooperate, particularly in the field of arms production. I am particularly impressed by Slovakia's production capacity in the field of ammunition, particularly the 155mm variety, although other types are also noteworthy. The potential for growth is considerable, ranking among the largest in Europe and the world. We wish to collaborate with you in the development of the arms industry, as you represent a strategic partner in this field - stated Deputy Prime Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz following a meeting with Slovak Defence Minister Robert Kaliňák.</title><link>https://www.gov.pl/web/national-defence/news</link><description>- We are together in the European Union, together in NATO.

It is imperative that Europe intensifies its efforts to provide assistance to Ukraine, with a particular focus on enhancing its security. Without increased expenditure and awareness of the necessity of such measures within the European public consciousness, the aforementioned measures will prove futile. Without an awareness of the importance of security in the contemporary era. It is our intention to reiterate this message at every opportunity, and it is our commitment as defence ministers to do so. It is of the utmost importance that we fulfil our roles in our countries, as well as in the wider European Union, in our interactions with the United Kingdom and in our friendship with the United States. I would like this to be emphasised, as we have all previously stated in our speeches how important it is for us to maintain relations with the United States, which have been the basis of our civilisation for many years - said Deputy Prime Minister W. Kosiniak-Kamysz following a meeting with defence ministers in Berlin.</title><link>https://www.gov.pl/web/national-defence/news</link><description>- It is our duty today to state this matter clearly and explicitly.

As General Kukuła observed, the lessons of the war in Ukraine are being implemented. It would be erroneous to assume that a one-off solution is being adopted - rather, flexibility is required. The ability to adapt is of paramount importance in order to ensure that the military is able to respond effectively to changing circumstances. (…) After two years and, in a moment, after three years of experience of the war in Ukraine, there must be an analysis and redefinition of the actions we are conducting - stated Deputy Prime Minister W.
